			<h3>Red Hat Certificate of Expertise in Seam Retired</h3>
			<p>The end is a new beginning. While Red Hat is retiring its old certification exams, other new exams are next in turn. Being the world's most trusted provider of Linux® and open source technology, Red Hat delivers an exhaustive portfolio of secure products and services using open, collaborative business model and an affordable, predictable subscription model.

			<p>Today we’ll talk about another credential called Red Hat Certificate of Expertise in Seam. As you have probably guessed, it is no longer available.  </p>
			<p>If you have already earned the Red Hat® Certificate of Expertise in Seam, you can undoubtedly show the skills, abilities and knowledge necessary to use Seam to tie together components when developing applications. You are proficient in: </p>

			<h3>A Few Interface Tweaks for the Google Play Store </h3>
			<p>Finally, there is a possibility for you to zoom in on screenshots, and the 'Entertainment' section has been renamed to 'Movies, Music, Books'. </p>
			<p>Google Play Store is considered to be always under construction which means it adds and renews tweaks and overhauls. The latest round of changes isn’t so gripping, but they can help you find what you’re searching for or more deeply examine some applications. </p>
			<p>It’s worth noticing that the main landing page has changed the section named “Entertainment” to “Movies, Music, Books.” This update is certain to simplify users’ tasks and make them understand what they can get in this section. It’s kind of a tight fit on smaller screens (this was taken from a Nexus 5X) but may look fine on phones, such as the Pixel XL or others with a big screen. </p>
			<p>Another most conspicuous change is that you can finally pinch and zoom on screenshots. It’s really helpful for picking out more details before deciding whether you want to download that app. </p>
			<p>Maybe you have already observed, when clicking a link to the Play Store from Chrome or another browser, you go right to a preview page that now is notable for much larger Google Play Store branding. </p>
			<p>Various Play Store sections being navigated, the white search bar vanishes. If you want to get to a voice search, it’s necessary to tap the bar and the microphone icon. For Google to make such a change, the company likely determined that few people were performing voice searches in the Play Store. </p>
			<p>Indeed, the most useful change Google made is the possibility to zoom in on screenshots. It may seem to be a minor thing, but with some game screenshots this makes it easier to figure out exactly what’s going on. And it may help those on smaller screens to get a better view of the action. </p>
